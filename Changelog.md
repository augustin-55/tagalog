# V1 : Complete version of the website like May advice me
    * We did a great website about "learn Tagalog". Gradually, she's becoming my existence, what I learn from life, in life. This website will be dedicated to us. I love you so much my May.

# V2 : "May and Augustin"
    * That's how I decided to call this blog. Our names together are the proves of my happiness, why I smile everyday. This blog will be consacrated to our life together. We're still apart, but we'll get there.

# Things to improve in V1.1 :
    * Add constraints if "description" fields are more than 255 caracters in admin part
    * Do sessions mecanism so that if there's no session at start of website -> redirect
    * Do verifications of form in add form (admin part)
    * Watch again about messages on portals (main and admin parts)
    * Checkbox in admin part and logic to choose what image we display on the carousel (travels page)
